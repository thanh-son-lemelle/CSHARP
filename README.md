# Hi Plateformersüëã
# <p align="center">Empire</p>
  
We are a group of 3 people and we need to create a game like Empire. We had 2 weeks to realize this project.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a turn-based RPG game titled Empire Deluxe, inspired by the classic games like Empire (1977) by Walter Bright. The game will allow players to explore a world map, engage in turn-based combat, and manage their team of characters. The project will be developed using C# and will incorporate object-oriented programming principles.

## Objectives
The primary objective is to create a playable turn-based RPG game with the following core functionalities:

- Exploration: The player can navigate a map using the arrow keys, encountering random battles similar to games like Pok√©mon.
- Combat System: Players will engage in 1v1 turn-based battles against AI opponents. Each turn, the player can choose an action such as attack, magic, or item usage.
- Character Management: Players will manage a team of characters with unique stats and abilities. These characters can level up, improving their attributes and unlocking new attacks.
- Inventory System: An inventory will allow players to store potions, keys, and other items that affect gameplay.
- Save and Load System: Players will have the ability to save and load their game progress.
    
## üßê Game Features  

- Map Navigation

The player controls a character on a map and can move around using the arrow keys.
Random encounters with enemies can occur, triggering battles.
The map will include chests, NPCs, and other interactable elements.

-Turn-Based Combat

Combat is 1v1 between a player-controlled character and an AI opponent.
Players can choose from various actions during their turn, such as:
  - Attack: Deal damage to the enemy.
  - Magic: Use abilities that consume mana, which regenerates over time.
  - Items: Use consumables from the inventory.
Combat relies on various stats such as attack, defense, speed, HP (health points), and MP (mana points).
Characters can land critical hits with attacks, and victory grants experience points (XP).

- Character Progression

Each character will have different stats like attack power, defense, speed, and accuracy.
Characters can level up by gaining experience through combat, enhancing their stats and unlocking new abilities.
If a character‚Äôs HP reaches zero, the player can replace them with another character from their team. If all characters are defeated, the game ends (Game Over).

- Inventory System

The game will feature an inventory where the player can store items like:
Potions to restore HP and MP.
Keys and special items for game progression.
Stat-boosting items.
Items can be accessed during battles or on the exploration map.

- AI-Driven Opponents

Enemy AI will range from simple attackers to more complex strategies that exploit player weaknesses.
The difficulty of the AI may vary depending on the enemy encountered.

- User Interface (UI)

A menu where the player can review their team‚Äôs stats, health, and available actions.
An inventory management screen to equip items or use consumables.
Save and load options to manage game progress.
